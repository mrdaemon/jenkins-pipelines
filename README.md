# jenkins-pipelines

Personal Collection of Jenkins Pipelines, for reference

This repository contains various Jenkins pipelines that i've created where
I don't really want to (or cannot) store them alongside the code they are meant
to build.

Feel free to use them as a reference, but keep in mind that they are tightly
coupled with my personal build environment, so they may not work out of the
box.
